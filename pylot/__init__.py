PyLoT - the Python picking and Localization Tool
================================================

This python library contains a graphical user interfaces for picking
seismic phases. This software needs ObsPy (http://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
and the Qt4 libraries to be installed first.

PILOT has been developed in Mathworks' MatLab. In order to distribute
PILOT without facing portability problems, it has been decided to re-
develop the software package in Python. The great work of the ObsPy
group allows easy handling of a bunch of seismic data and PyLoT will
benefit a lot compared to the former MatLab version.

The development of PyLoT is part of the joint research project MAGS2.
