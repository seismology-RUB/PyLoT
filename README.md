# PyLoT

version: 0.1a

The Python picking and Localisation Tool

This python library contains a graphical user interfaces for picking
seismic phases. This software needs [ObsPy][ObsPy]
and the PySide Qt4 bindings for python to be installed first.

PILOT has originally been developed in Mathworks' MatLab. In order to
distribute PILOT without facing portability problems, it has been decided
to redevelop the software package in Python. The great work of the ObsPy
group allows easy handling of a bunch of seismic data and PyLoT will
benefit a lot compared to the former MatLab version.

The development of PyLoT is part of the joint research project MAGS2.

##Installation

At the moment there is no automatic installation procedure available for PyLoT.
Best way to install is to clone the repository and add the path to your Python path.

####prerequisites:

In order to run PyLoT you need to install:

- python
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- obspy
- pyside

####some handwork

PyLoT needs a properties folder on your system to work. It should be situated in your home directory:

    mkdir ~/.pylot

In the next step you have to copy some files to this directory:

    cp path-to-pylot/inputs/pylot.in ~/.pylot/

for local distance seismicity

    cp path-to-pylot/inputs/autoPyLoT_local.in ~/.pylot/autoPyLoT.in

for regional distance seismicity

    cp path-to-pylot/inputs/autoPyLoT_regional.in ~/.pylot/autoPyLoT.in

and some extra information on filtering, error estimates (just needed for reading old PILOT data) and the Richter magnitude scaling relation

    cp path-to-pylot/inputs/filter.in path-to-pylot/inputs/PILOT_TimeErrors.in path-to-pylot/inputs/richter_scaling.data ~/.pylot/

You may need to do some modifications to these files. Especially folder names should be reviewed.

PyLoT has been tested on Mac OSX (10.11) and Debian Linux 8.


##release notes:
==============

#### Features

- consistent manual phase picking through predefined SNR dependant zoom level
- uniform uncertainty estimation from waveform's properties for automatic and manual picks
- pdf representation and comparison of picks taking the uncertainty intrinsically into account 
- Richter and moment magnitude estimation
- location determination with external installation of [NonLinLoc](http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/index.html)

#### Known issues

- Magnitude estimation from manual PyLoT takes some time (instrument correction)

We hope to solve these with the next release.
