PyLoT 

version: 0.1

The Python picking and Localisation Tool

This python library contains a graphical user interfaces for picking
seismic phases. This software needs ObsPy (http://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
and the Qt4 libraries to be installed first.

PILOT has originally been developed in Mathworks' MatLab. In order to
distribute PILOT without facing portability problems, it has been decided
to redevelop the software package in Python. The great work of the ObsPy
group allows easy handling of a bunch of seismic data and PyLoT will
benefit a lot compared to the former MatLab version.

The development of PyLoT is part of the joint research project MAGS2.
